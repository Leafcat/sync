#### Liability for content
After common law we, as service provider, are responsible for our content on this website. However, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third party content or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the common laws remain untouched. However, a relevant liability is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific infringement. If we become aware of such violations, we will remove that content immediately.

#### Liability for links
Our website contains links to external websites over which we have no control. Therefore we can not take any responsibility for their content. The respective provider or operator is always responsible for the contents of any linked site. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible legal violations. Illegal contents were not found at the time of linking. A permanent monitoring of the linked pages for legal violations is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we become aware of such violations, we will remove these links immediately.
